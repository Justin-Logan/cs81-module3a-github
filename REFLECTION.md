# Git Assignment Reflection

This assignment has taught me a lot about how Git works. I also took some time to dive deeper into the topic and researched how it can help with project tracking and organization within a team environment.

## Key Learnings

- **`git add`**  
  Stages any changes made in a file to a *staging area*.

- **Staging/Unstaging Awareness**  
  Git does **not** track the act of staging or unstaging changes themselves.

- **`git commit`**  
  Saves the changes made â€” or more specifically, takes the staged changes and stores them in the **local repository**.

- **`git push`**  
  Sends your committed changes to a **remote repository**.

- **Importance of Pushing**  
  If you don't push your changes and you lose your local repo, all your work is lost.

- **Collaborative Work**  
  When working with others on the same project, Git might **reject your push** if the remote repository has been updated since your last pull.

- **Conflict Resolution**  
  You may need to **resolve conflicts by merging** changes when working collaboratively.
